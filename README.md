Software Design Individual Spring 2014
====

About
----
This repo contains my individual assignments from the class
[Software Design Lab][1] (CSC-221), which I took at [City College][2]
during the Spring 2014 semester with [Prof. George Wolberg][3]. The
class was a mix of GUI programming and Computer Graphics, and it
featured material about the following technologies:

* [C++][4]
* [Qt][5]
* [OpenGL][6]
* [Microsoft Kinect][7]

The Software Design lab class also involved some work done in teams.
That team work can be found in [this repo][8].

Outline
----
* Assignment 1 - [Demo UI for the LED Cube Simulator Project][9]
* Assignment 2 - [Same demo UI as before but with a stock cube simulation][10]
* Assignment 3 - [Working UI with a custom cube-lattice simulation][11]
