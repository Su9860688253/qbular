This repo contains my assignments from the class [Software Design Lab][1] (CSC-221), which I took at [City College][2] during the Spring 2014 semester with [Prof. George Wolberg][3]. The class was a mix of GUI programming and Computer Graphics, and it featured material about the following technologies:

* [C++][4]
* [Qt][5]
* [OpenGL][6]
* [Microsoft Kinect][7]
